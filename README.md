# 🔥 SOC Firewall Log Analysis using Splunk SIEM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-world firewall log analysis using Splunk SIEM.  
The objective is to detect suspicious IP activity, blocked traffic patterns, and port scanning behavior using SOC investigation queries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Splunk Enterprise (SIEM)
- Firewall Log Dataset (CSV)
- Windows VM Lab
- SPL (Search Processing Language)

## 📂 Project Structure
- firewall_logs.csv → Sample firewall dataset
- queries.txt → SOC detection queries
- screenshots/ → Splunk analysis proof

## 🛡️ Key SOC Use Case Queries (Primary)
These queries simulate real SOC L1 analyst investigations:

### 1. Top Suspicious Source IP Detection

index=firewall | stats count by src_ip | sort -count


### 2. Blocked vs Allowed Traffic Monitoring

index=firewall | stats count by action


### 3. Most Targeted Ports Analysis

index=firewall | stats count by dest_port | sort -count


### 4. Port Scanning Detection (Nmap Behavior)

index=firewall | stats dc(dest_port) as unique_ports by src_ip | where unique_ports > 5


### 5. Suspicious Blocked IP Investigation


index=firewall action=blocked | stats count by src_ip | sort -count


## 🧠 Additional Investigation Queries (Optional)

index=firewall | timechart count by action
index=firewall | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip
index=firewall (dest_port=22 OR dest_port=3389 OR dest_port=445)


## 📊 SOC Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM Log Ingestion (Custom Index Creation)
- Firewall Log Analysis
- Threat Detection using SPL Queries
- Port Scanning Identification
- Suspicious IP Investigation
- SOC Analyst Investigation Workflow

## 📸 Screenshots
Screenshots of data ingestion, firewall log analysis, and detection queries are included in the screenshots folder as proof of hands-on lab.

### 🔥 1. Top Suspicious Source IP Detection
This query identifies the most active and potentially suspicious source IP addresses.

```spl
index=firewall | stats count by src_ip | sort -count
